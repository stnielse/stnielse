## 🔁 Contributions from My Enterprise Account

While this GitHub account reflects a significant part of my engineering work, I also actively contribute to other internal repositories at **Myriad** on our GitHub Enterprise Server.

🔒 GitHub Enterprise Server: `https://github.myriad.com/stnielse`

Due to privacy and access controls, most of this work is private, but depending on the day can contain a large portion of my output.
