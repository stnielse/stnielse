## ⬅️  A little bit about myself 🏔️🏃🚴📚

My name is Steven and I'm a software engineer with an academic foundation in physics and applied mathematics, which I use to approach challenges with a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset. I enjoy bridging theory and implementation, turning complex ideas into efficient, maintainable code. My go-to languages are Python and TypeScript but really I love jumping into everything! Outside of the computer, you'll find me pushing limits as an endurance athlete—trail running, road biking, and mountain biking. I thrive on solving hard problems, both on the trail and in the codebase.

## 🔁 Contributions from My Enterprise Account

While this GitHub account reflects a significant part of my engineering work, I also actively contribute to other internal repositories at **Myriad** on our 🔒 GitHub Enterprise Server: `https://github.myriad.com/stnielse`

Due to security controls, most of this work is private, but depending on the day can contain a large portion of my output.
